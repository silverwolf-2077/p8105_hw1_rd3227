# Problem 1

Load the moderndive library and the early_january_weather dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

Take a look at the dataset help file.

``` r
help("early_january_weather")
```

The early_january_weather dataset contains hourly meteorological data
for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It is a data frame
of 358 rows representing hourly measurements and 15 variables, including
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The mean temperature
measured in these places during this period is 39.5821229.

Make a scatterplot of temp vs time_hour, color points using the humid
variable and save it to the project directory.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf")
```

Overall, both temperature and humidity show a gradual increasing trend
over the course of the dataset. Looking at individual days, it is clear
that temperature fluctuates considerably within each day, indicating
large daily temperature variations.

# Problem 2

Create a data frame.

``` r
my_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = x > 0,
    vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Good","Good","Bad","Average","Bad","Good","Average","Average","Bad","Good"))
  )
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

``` r
mean(my_df$x)
```

    ## [1] -0.06436028

``` r
mean(my_df$greater_0)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(my_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(my_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(my_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(my_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

For x(random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution) and
greater_0(logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
greater than 0), it works.

For vec_char(character vector of length 10) and vec_factor(factor vector
of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”), it doesn’t work.

Convert the variables to numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(my_df$x)
```

    ##  [1]  0.02303967 -0.99764385  0.73644050 -1.81135707  0.93500717 -0.55449303
    ##  [7]  0.95943021  0.47367894 -0.53066879  0.12296349

``` r
as.numeric(my_df$greater_0)
```

    ##  [1] 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1

``` r
as.numeric(my_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(my_df$vec_factor)
```

    ##  [1] 3 3 2 1 2 3 1 1 2 3
