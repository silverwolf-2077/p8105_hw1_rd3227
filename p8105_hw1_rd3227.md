# Problem 1

Load the moderndive library and the early_january_weather dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

Take a look at the dataset help file.

``` r
help("early_january_weather")
```

The early_january_weather dataset contains hourly meteorological data
for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It is a data frame
of 358 rows representing hourly measurements and 15 variables, including
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The mean temperature
measured in these places during this period is 39.5821229.

Make a scatterplot of temp vs time_hour, color points using the humid
variable and save it to the project directory.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Overall, both temperature and humidity show a gradual increasing trend
over the course of the dataset. Looking at individual days, it is clear
that temperature fluctuates considerably within each day, indicating
large daily temperature variations.

# Problem 2

Create a data frame.

``` r
my_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = x > 0,
    vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Good","Good","Bad","Average","Bad","Good","Average","Average","Bad","Good"))
  )
```
