# Problem 1

Load the moderndive library and the early_january_weather dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

Take a look at the dataset help file.

``` r
help("early_january_weather")
```

The early_january_weather dataset contains hourly meteorological data
for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It is a data frame
of 358 rows representing hourly measurements and 15 variables, including
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The mean temperature
measured in these places during this period is 39.5821229.

Make a scatterplot of temp vs time_hour, color points using the humid
variable and save it to the project directory.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Overall, both temperature and humidity show a gradual increasing trend
over the course of the dataset. Looking at individual days, it is clear
that temperature fluctuates considerably within each day, indicating
large daily temperature variations.

# Problem 2

Create a data frame.

``` r
my_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = x > 0,
    vec_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Good","Good","Bad","Average","Bad","Good","Average","Average","Bad","Good"))
  )
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, x))
```

    ## [1] 0.095638

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, greater_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(my_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(my_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

For x(random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution) and
greater_0(logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
greater than 0), it works.

For vec_char(character vector of length 10) and vec_factor(factor vector
of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”), it doesn’t work.

Convert the variables to numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(my_df$x)
as.numeric(my_df$greater_0)
as.numeric(my_df$vec_char)
as.numeric(my_df$vec_factor)
```

The as.numeric function works for the variables x, greater_0 and
vec_factor, but when applied to vec_char, it shows “Warning: NAs
introduced by coercion”. This shows that mean() works directly only on
numeric and logical variables, character variables cannot be averaged,
and factor variables need to be explicitly converted to numeric to
compute a mean.
