# Problem 1

Load the moderndive library and the early_january_weather dataset.

```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

Take a look at the dataset help file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
help("early_january_weather")
```

The early_january_weather dataset contains hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It is a data frame of `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows representing hourly measurements and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` variables, including `r names(early_january_weather)`. The mean temperature measured in these places during this period is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.
